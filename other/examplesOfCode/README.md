This is unfortunately all I could salvage of the Chat portion I worked on for this start up. The file is big I supose;
I used pubnub which is like a comercialized socket io client, for the messaging.

More importantly, I maximize the utilization of the context api in react to reduce post calls to the server and to
pass props down the children much easier than through the component tree.
