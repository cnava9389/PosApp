## My Site

### credentials for test `test@test.com`, `test`

The site uses typescript in combination with solid js and a database to create a web app point of sale system This app is
very bare-bones and has a lot of features that I have yet to implement.as of right now, you must create account to use

(except with the above test credentials) the app.In the app you can create menu items with plenty of different options and
functionality, you can then go into the create order section to create orders and post them to the database. you are also

able to pay for the orders in the orders section as well as filter the paid and unpaid orders. Many more things to come ...
